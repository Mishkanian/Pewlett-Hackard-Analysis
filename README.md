# Preparing for a Wave of Retirement

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the employment database of the fictional company 'Pewlett-Hackard' to find the number of retiring employees by position. To prepare for the incoming waves of retirement, it is suggested to create a mentorship program to train the next generation of employees. The feasibility of this proposed program is also investigated.

## Resources and Software
The following six CSV data files were provided at the beginning of the analysis: 
- departments.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, titles.csv
  - These starting files are found inside of the [Data folder](https://github.com/Mishkanian/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/tree/main/Data).
- PostgreSQL 13.2
- pgAdmin 4.50

## Results

The table below shows the number of retiring employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 grouped by title in the company.
